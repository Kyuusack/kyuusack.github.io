Welcome to my GitHub! I’m a Security Analyst with a strong interest in the broad field of cybersecurity—currently focused on SIEM Engineering and learning by doing through real-world cases and experimentation.

🔍 About Me
I come from a non-coding background, but my passion for cybersecurity drives me to explore and build. While I may not be a programmer by trade, I leverage the power of AI tools to help create and customize scripts, automate tasks, and enhance detection workflows—proving that technical barriers can be overcome with creativity and the right resources.

🛠️ Skills
Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)

Elastic Stack (Elasticsearch, Kibana, Logstash, Beats)

Detection Engineering & Rule Writing

Threat Hunting & Log Analysis

Incident Response Support

AI-Assisted Scripting (Python, Bash, etc.)

🚀 Current Focus
Designing and tuning detection rules in Elastic SIEM

Building enrichment pipelines and runtime field mappings

Integrating with threat intelligence feeds and endpoint logs

Applying MITRE ATT&CK for structured threat detection

🤖 My Approach
I believe that not knowing how to code shouldn’t stop anyone from building. With the help of AI tools like ChatGPT and Copilot, I’ve been able to craft scripts, automate detection logic, and contribute meaningfully to cybersecurity workflows.
