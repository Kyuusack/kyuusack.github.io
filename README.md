Welcome to my GitHub! I’m a Security Analyst passionate about the Blue Team side of cybersecurity—focusing on detection engineering, threat monitoring, and incident response. I’m currently exploring the SIEM Engineering domain and learning by doing through real-world log data and alert handling.

🔍 About Me
My background is not in software development, but I’ve developed a strong interest in cybersecurity, especially from a defensive (Blue Team) perspective. I’ve gained practical experience with log analysis, alert triage, and threat detection—primarily working with the Elastic Stack (Elasticsearch, Kibana, Logstash) as my core SIEM platform.
To overcome coding challenges, I leverage AI tools like ChatGPT to assist in building scripts, automating detection use cases, and customizing SIEM workflows.

💼 Experience & Blue Team Focus
Building and fine-tuning detection rules in Elastic SIEM

Investigating alerts and correlating events using log data from EDR, firewalls, and endpoint telemetry

Performing basic threat hunting using KQL/ES|QL in Kibana

Creating transform pipelines, runtime mappings, and alert enrichment

Familiar with MITRE ATT&CK, used to structure and map detection coverage

Supporting incident response teams by providing log evidence and user/IP profiling

🧭 Goal
I’m committed to deepening my expertise in Blue Team operations, including advanced detection engineering, threat intelligence integration, and automation. My goal is to grow into a more technical role such as SIEM Engineer, Detection Engineer, or Threat Hunter.

🛠️ Skills
Elastic Stack (Kibana, Elasticsearch, Logstash, Beats)

Detection Engineering & SIEM Rule Writing

Threat Hunting & Log Analysis

Basic Scripting (Python/Bash) using AI assistance

Alert Enrichment & Correlation

Knowledge of Windows Security Events, EDR logs, Fortigate logs

MITRE ATT&CK Mapping

🤖 My Approach
While I don’t have a deep programming background, I actively use AI tools to close the gap—whether that’s generating scripts, decoding error messages, or drafting detection logic. I believe modern defenders can be both strategic and technical—with the right tools and mindset.
